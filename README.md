##Mario Kart MAL

This project was started as an assigment for the Physics II, subject at CITM, UPC Terrassa. Created by one student in the second year of the Videogames Design and Development career. 
The idea was to create this mini game where you drive a car and prove some physics.
The game consists in a race that you have to do all the lap before the time goes to 0.


### Controls
- W for go forward.

- A for left direction.

- D for right direction.

- S for go backward.

Special debug keys:

- F1 to make the time to 100.
- F2 to make the time to 0(lose automatically).
