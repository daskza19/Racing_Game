## Inverse DGT

This project was started as an assigment for the Physics II, subject at CITM, UPC Terrassa. Created by one student in the second year of the Videogames Design and Development career. 
The idea was to create this mini game where you drive a car and prove some physics.
The game consists in a race that you have to drive over the mininum speed that changes every 10 seconds. If you are below the mininum speed you lose.
